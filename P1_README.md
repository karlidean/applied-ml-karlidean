# P1: Tools and Intro to ML & Engage
## About
- This project is for week 1 of 44-670 (Applied Machine Learning) at Northwest Missouri State University. We analyzed customer housing data in California to train and test a model to understand if we can predict the Median House Value in the state of California.
- To do this, we looked at the median house price and leveraged it using the number of rooms in a house, something big to consider when providing for things like a family, pets, or office spaces.
