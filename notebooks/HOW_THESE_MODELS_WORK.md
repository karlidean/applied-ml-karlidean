# How These Models Work
## Model 1: California Housing Price Prediction
You can find this model [here](https://github.com/karlidean/applied-ml-karlidean/blob/main/notebooks/project01/ml01.ipynb)!
- Utilized Jupyter Notebooks to predict prices of houses in the state of California.
- Used visualization techniques in the Seaborn pack like boxplots, histograms, and pairplots.
- Trained a model using `train_test_split()`
- Evaluated the model using R2, RMSE, and MAE scores
- Predicts the MEDIAN price based on certain home features. My features selected were as follows:
  - The owner's median income (MedInc)
  - The average number of rooms in a home (AveRooms)
