# How These Models Work
## Model 1: California Housing Price Prediction
You can find this model [here](https://github.com/karlidean/applied-ml-karlidean/blob/main/notebooks/project01/ml01.ipynb)!
- Utilized Jupyter Notebooks to predict housing prices in the state of California
- Used visualization techniques from the Seaborn package, including boxplots, histograms, and pairplots
- Trained a model using `train_test_split()`
- Evaluated the model using R², RMSE, and MAE scores
- Predicted the **median house price** based on selected home features:
  - The owner's median income (`MedInc`)
  - The average number of rooms in a home (`AveRooms`)
