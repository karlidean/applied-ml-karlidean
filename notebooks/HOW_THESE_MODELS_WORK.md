# How These Models Work
## Model 1: California Housing Price Prediction
You can find this model [here](link)!\
Utilized Jupyter Notebooks to predict prices of houses in the state of California.\
Predicts the MEDIAN price based on certain home features. My features selected were as follows:
- The owner's median income (MedInc)
- The average number of rooms in a home (AveRooms)
Used visualization techniques in the Seaborn pack like boxplots, histograms, and pairplots.\
Trained a model using `train_test_split()`\
Evaluated the model using R2, RMSE, and MAE scores\
